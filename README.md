# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

WAKE UP BRICE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and the United States needs your expertise. The brilliant minds at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports & can prove alien existence! Now you must put this information online for the ENTIRE WORLD to see.

There is one tiny problem t...  collection of evidence is way too large to search through manually. 

 Write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). Be sure to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. ONLY use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. 

## Your Task

### Before You Begin
1. Create a new repository for this project called `javascript-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Javascript challenge. Use the folder names to correspond to the challenges: **UFO-level-1** and **UFO-level-2**.

4. Add your **html** files to this folder as well as your static folder containing your javascript. This will be the main script to run for analysis.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

6. Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file
